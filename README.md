## Requirements

Angular requires Node.js version 8.x or 10.x. and an npm package manager.

## Before serve

You need to install dependencies with `npm install` command.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
